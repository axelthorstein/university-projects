 \item (15 points) State necessary and sufficient conditions on an ordered $n$-tuple of positive integers
 $(d_1, \dots, d_n)$ with $d_1 \le d_2 \le \dots \le d_n$ in order that there be a tree $T$ on vertices $u_1, \dots, u_n$
 with $\text{deg}_T(u_i) = d_i$ for each $i \in \{1, \dots, n \}$.

\begin{problem}
 \item (5 points) A full ternary tree is an ordered rooted tree where each vertex, except the leaves, has 
 exactly $3$ children. Hence, all of the internal vertices have degree four, except the root which has degree 
 $3$. Prove the \textit{Full Ternary Tree Theorem} which states that a regular ternary tree has $n = 3k+1$ vertices,

\section{Eulerian Graphs ({\bf max 25})}

\begin{problem}
\item
 Consider the $3 \times 3$ chessboard, and let $Q$ denote the $9$ squares of the board. Let 
 $H_{3,3} = (Q, E)$ denote the simple graph on vertex set $Q$ so that $(q_1, q_2) \in E$ if and 
 only if a rook at square $q_1$ can reach $q_2$ in a single move (a rook can move 
 horizontally and vertically  arbitrary distance).
\begin{subprob}
 \item (5 points) Run \textit{Fleury's algorithm} for computing an Eulerian circuit on $H_{3,3}$. The algorithm on a simple graph $G=(V,E)$ is as follows: 
 \begin{quote}
 Pick a vertex $v_1$ arbitrarily. Having picked $v_1, \dots, v_k$,  set 
 $G_k = G \, - \, \{e_{1,2}, e_{2,3}, \dots, e_{{k-2},{k-1}}, e_{{k-1},k} \}$, where $e_{i,j}$ denotes
 an edge connecting $v_i$ to $v_j$.
 If there is a non-bridge (in $G_k$) edge connecting $v_k$ to a vertex $u$ then let 
 $v_{k+1} = u$. Otherwise, let $v_{k+1}$ be any neighbor of $v_k$ in $G_k$. If the degree of $v_k$ in
 $G_k$ is $0$ then terminate. Repeat. 
 \end{quote}
 
\item  (5 points) Consider the general $n \times m$ chessboard, for $n,m \ge 1$, and similarly the graph $H_{n,m}$ so that two vertices (squares) are adjacent if and only if a rook can get from one to the other in one move. For which values $n,m$ does the graph $H_{m,n}$ contain a Euler circuit?
 \item (10 points) Prove that Fleury's algorithm always finds an Eulerian circuit if there is one. 
\end{subprob}
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}
\item (10 points) For an integer $k$, let $G$ be a connected graph that contains $2k$ vertices of odd degree. Show that there exist $k$ edge-disjoint subgraphs $G_1, \dots, G_k$ such that
 \begin{itemize}
  \item $E(G) = E(G_1) \cup E(G_2) \cup \dots \cup E(G_k)$,
  \item each $G_i$ has an Eulerian trail.
 \end{itemize}
 
\tiny{Hint: Add $k$ edges to $G$ so that it becomes Eulerian.}

 \item (10 points) Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers. Consider the \textit{grid graph} $G_{m,n} = (V, E)$ with vertex set $V = \{1, \dots, m\} \times \{1, \dots, n\}$, where vertices $u = (x, y) \in V$ and $v = (x', y') \in V$ are adjacent if and only if $|x - x'| + |y - y'| = 1$. Find necessary and sufficient conditions that $m$ and $n$ must satisfy in order for the graph $G_{m,n}$ to be Hamiltonian.

\section{Connectivity ({\bf max 30})}


\begin{problem}
 \item (5 points) Show that a vertex $u$ in a graph $G$ is a cut-vertex if, and only if, there are vertices $v, w \in V(G) \setminus \{u\}$ such that every path between $v$ and $w$ contains the vertex $u$.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}
 \item (10 points) Show that if $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, we have:
 \[
  \kappa(G) \le \kappa'(G) \le \left\lfloor \frac{2m}{n} \right\rfloor .
 \]

\begin{solution}
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}
 \item (10 points) Let $G$ be a connected graph. Show that if $C \subseteq E(G)$ has an even number of edges in common with every edge cut of $G$, then $C$ is an edge-disjoint union of cycles.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}

 \item (5 points) For a tree $T$ on $n$ vertices and with maximum degree $\Delta$,
