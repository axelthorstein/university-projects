\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 From fairest creatures we desire increase,\
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,\
But as the riper should by time decease,\
His tender heir might bear his memory:\
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,\
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,\
Making a famine where abundance lies,\
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:\
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,\
And only herald to the gaudy spring,\
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,\
And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:\
  Pity the world, or else this glutton be,\
  To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.\
